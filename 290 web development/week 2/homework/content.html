		<h3>Raw API Data</h3>
                <p>  
                     For this section of the how-to we will look at what
		     the api returns and how best to parse through it, including the differences between 
		     the three versions. Since the GET calls are the easiest, we will look at those first. 
		     From there we will take a look at the first POST call and then point out any differences
		     between it and the last POST call. 
                </p>
                <p>      
                     In this part of the how-to we will be focusing on the Local Area Unemployment Statistics.
                     However, once you get the hang of one catagory you can get the general feel for all the
                     other catagoies as well.
                </p>
		<p>      
                     For all calls except 
		<a href=http://www.bls.gov/developers/api_signature_v2.htm#parameters>v2's second POST call</a>
		     , the return data will look like the picture below. This means you can see things like
		     how long the request took, if there are any messages attached to the return data, as well
                     as the data itself. In addition, each piece data comes with the year, the month (M13 for
		     annual) and any footnote about that data.

		<p>      
                     There are a couple of things you need to take note of. The first is that we will be using the
		     express and request packages for this how to, so if you don't have those you will need to
                     install them. The other thing to note is that this how-to doesn't cover error checking. But I 
                     will point our where you can do so. To find out more about the types of errors you may get,
                     you will need to check out 
		     <a href=http://www.bls.gov/developers/api_faqs.htm>this page</a>
 		     for common text errors and http errors. 
		</p>
		<p>
		     Text errors will return with an http response code of
 		     200 but the content of the message will look similar to the below picture. As such when error
		     checking you will need to look at the message part of the response. If no error has occurred
  		     message should be empty. This how-to will not go over what to do in case of an error as that
		     that is really up to the developer, but we will go over when and where you can catch these
		     errors.

                <h3>GET Calls: Single series</h3>
                <p>
                      Okay, now for some actual coding. Lets take a look first at the call to the server:
                </p>
		<a href="GET.png"><img src="GET.png"></a>
		<p>
		      Lets first look at the function call line : <code>app.get('/h9',function(req,res,next){</code>.
		      For this function we are assuming that the request data that was sent to the function is a
		      GET query. To find out what we are asking them to send we need to look at the request line:
		      <code>request('http://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/' + req.query.seriesid, 
		      function(err, response, body){</code>. Here we can see that we are taking a query name seriesid
                      and attaching it to the web address for the api. If we look at the required format of the GET
                      call we know that the seriesid holds the value of the series ID we are looking for.
		</p>
		<p>
		      While looking at the request line, I'm sure you noticed the <code>function(err, response, body){</code>
		      part of the line. This is our callback function. We have to have a callback function due to
		<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing>CORS</a>. Without this part, we wont be
		      allowed to get any data from the BLS. This is also where we will work with the data we get back
 		      from our request, which is stored in the body parameter of our callback function.
		</p>
		<p>
      		      The first thing we do when we enter the function is check if our request succeed by checking
                      if there wasn't an error and the response's statuscode was 200: <code>if(!err && response.statusCode == 200){</code>
		      (as I said earlier, you will need to check the BLS for what other http status codes the 
		      site might send you.) Once we varify that we got a response, we need to parse through it. For
		      This we use <code>JSON.parse(body)</code>. This allows us to use dot notation to dereference
		      the different parts of our code. From here on what you do is really determined by what you are
		      wanting to do with the data. In this how-to I will simply be accessing the different parts and
		      saving them.
		</p>
		<p>
		      Once our data is parsed, you can check if there are any text error messages. If there is then you will
		      need to handle the error and not try to access the data as that will throw an error. If the message field
		      of our data is empty, then that means you can work on the Results field. Results's value is for some
		      reason an array that always only has one thing, an object with the name series. Series's value is also
		      always an array, but considering that the POST requests can take more than one series ID, at
		      least this being an array makes sense. So to access the series data we need to dereference these
		      fields and (since there is only one series ID for the GET call) access the first index of series in
		      order to finally get to the data field. Data also is an array that holds 3 years worth in the form
		      of objects. These objects are the things we need to derefernce to get to the values we are looking
		      to store.
		</p>
		<p>
		      In order to get to these values, we need to loop through all the objects in the data field. We do
		      this with the line: <code>while(myseries.series[0].data[myi] != undefined){</code>. From there
		      we can save that object's field values.
		</p>
		<code>
		      context.seriesid = myseries.series[0].seriesid;<br>
		      context.series.push({"value":myseries.series[0].data[myi].value,<br>
					   "month":myseries.series[0].data[myi].periodName,<br>
					   "year":myseries.series[0].data[myi].year,<br>
		</code>
		
		<p>
		      The first thing we do is save the series ID to context so that the html page we send this data
		      to can display it. Then we save all the values in each object into another object that we push
		      onto the array series, which we had made earlier in the function. Once all of the object are
  		      processed, we can go ahead and render the html page we are sending this data to: 
		      <code>res.render('home',context);</code>. In this case I am calling the html page home and
		      sending it the data for the requested series ID.
		</p>
		<p>
		      Everything after all of that is where you will handle http errors. In this case I am simply sending
		      the error on to the next appropriate function that can handle the error. However, if you want to
	  	      handle errors inside of the function simply remove the next parameter for the function call:
		      <code>app.get('/h9',function(req,res,next)</code>. After substitute <code>next(err);</code> with 
		      your error handling code.
